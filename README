PPPstat version 0.5.0 Copyright (C) 2005 Matviychuk Oleg

PPPstat aimed to collect a statistic of pppd sessions, based on pppd
logs via syslogd. There is /usr/local/etc/pppstat.conf which contains
IPs of modem pools of each ISP. It's intended to replace ugly IPs by
ISP name. You are free to send me info about your ISPs and I'll include 
them into the next releases.

LIMITATIONS

Time counting depends on stability of your system clock, because 
PPPstat uses time stamps of syslogd.

Probably won't work on machine, which works as dialup server - mixed 
logs and so on.

There is no documentation yet. You may help me with it ;)
