LIMITATIONS

Time counting depends on stability of your system clock, because 
PPPstat uses time stamps of syslogd.

Currently, ISP is differentiated by IP of remote host, that's why if 
your ISP have multiple modem pools, they would be treated as different 
ISPs.

Probably won't work on machine, which works as dialup server - mixed 
logs and so on.

It was tried only on RH-based distributions.
