2005-autumn Matviychuk Oleg <mathway.narod.ru>

	* filework.c: was found strange bug in gcc <= 3.3.5. That's why
	  I was forced to use sscanf() instead of atof() while parsing logs.

2005-summer Matviychuk Oleg <mathway.narod.ru>

	* Source was splitted into 4 files.
	* Now I can call PPPstat GNU compatible - it uses autotools.
	* Implemented usage of gettext().
